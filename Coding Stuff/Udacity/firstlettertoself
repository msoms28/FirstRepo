**So you're stuck.**

Got your big boy coder pants on and you :shit: them.  :laughing:

Keep your head up.  It appears that this is the normal :broken_heart: stage
of learning to code.

Your co-workers are great resources.  Many of them have been through
similar experiences in the bootcamps and classes that they have taken.  Use
them as a resource.  They also know how to apply this to our homegrown
application.  This is the start of your future and will set you up to
succeed in the long term.

If all else fails, keep in mind what [Joyce
Akiko](http://www.codeconquest.com/blog/how-to-navigate-the-up-and-downs-of-learning-to-code/)
said:

>1. When you hit a problem, check your thoughts. If they sound anything
like âIâm so stupid, Iâll never get thisâ or âEveryone else is lightyears
ahead, Iâll never get paid to do thisâ, change your thoughts to questions
instead. For example: what can I learn from this? How can I improve?

>2. Donât tally up successes and. setbacks. Instead, focus on all the
things that you learned that day and imagine all the things you will learn
tomorrow.

>3. Instead of comparing yourself to people who are farther along, think
about how hard those people had to work to get where they are today.

For you, comparing yourself will be your :mount_fuji:.  Yes I know that is
Mt. Fuji but there was no Everest!

Jump back into the "Dangerzone."  Get it done by using resources such as
Stack Overflow, W3Schools, or just simply Googling.  You can make it.
Don't give up!

Best of luck, me!


GOALS:

Forgot them the first time.  Was too excited about markdown.

>1. Leverage the HTML and CSS I already know to move forward in Front End
Development

>2. Learn jQuery, JavaScript, and figure out what Bootstrap is to make webpages
interactive and look cool

>3. Learn git to catch up with the rest of my work crew!

>4. Learn skills to continue learning moving forward and keeping up with the
ever-changing technology

>5. Have fun with new skills!

What advice do you have for someone who has been in a process management role at
AT&T adding skills to match the web-developers?
